I am an engineering and product leader that specializes in planning, building, and launching products for everything from startups to Fortune 500 companies.

I am the person that you hire to take a product idea from 0 to 1. I start as a product manager and work with stakeholders and potential customers to build out a product vision.

Then I become a CTO and turn that vision into an executable product road map with a concrete timeline and deadlines. Soon I am a software engineer writing beautiful and maintainable code, while I hire a dream team to make the dream work.

Rapidly we have an MVP to launch. I handle the go-to-market strategy on the product side, while handling the production strategy on the engineering side, ensuring that our application has at least a 99.99% uptime using world-class site reliability engineering and a "shift left" cybersecurity approach.

We launch and soon I am flying out to customers closing deals as a sales engineer, and then building long-term relationships as a solutions architect, ensuring customer success by working with them to solve their company's biggest challenges.

Lastly and most importantly, throughout this process I am a leader whose goal is to coach and mentor each individual towards their own personal greatness.

Some cool things I've done:

• I've helped move Disney's films (from physical tape!) into Azure, and then engineered a way for them to be sent digitally to movie theaters around the world, and then turned that technical marvel into a product that Disney could offer to movie theaters.

• I've optimized the building, testing, and deploying of cutting-edge algorithms to Elon Musk's hyperloop, a futuristic form of transportation consisting of levitating pods that fly at near sonic speeds, by taking a product management approach to the hyperloop's SDLC.

• I've obtained security clearance and have improved American national security by helping build the world's first nuclear compliant cloud platform.
